One Time Pad
==

A live preview of this application can be viewed [**here**][preview].

This application is a very simple one time pad. This pad allows you to input a message and a key (if no key, it will generate one which is **NOT SECURE**) and outputs the encrypted message. Conversely, you can also input a cryptographic message and a key to decode the message.
